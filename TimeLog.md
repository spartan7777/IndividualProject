Enterprise Java: Weekly Reflection - Time Logs

Week 1
1/21/2020 - 1/28/2020 - 10 hours

Tasks Completed:
Completed all Week 1 assignments
Started thinking on an individual project
Started documenting the project plan

Struggles: 
I have a good idea of what I am going to do for the project. My struggles continue to be internal. I am not sure why I feel the way I do, but I need to work on some more Java so that my confidence can be where I feel I need it to be. A lot of this could be nervousness as I get ready to enter the IT world and cease being a student. A lot of this is probably from the fact that I see professional at work all day and I cannot see them as ever have been where I am a little insecure, and new to all of this. I guess I need some different role models... 
Bottom line, I need to work on this insecurity before it follows me throughout the semester. 

I believe I have a solid idea for the individual project, and will just need to discuss it with the instructor to see if I can make it work. Hopefully my fears will not paralyze me once if becomes time to begin work on it. 

Next Week Plan:
I need to work on Week 2 assignments and avoid falling behind. Must ask questions as needed and be sure that I am working on Java outside of the coursework to gain that confidence that I do not feel I have at this time. Work on getting a complete view for the individual project and also start looking at the professional development activity as well. 



Week 2
1/29/2020 - 2/4/2020 - 14 hours

Tasks Completed:
Completed thinking on an individual project
Started documenting the project plan
Viewed several hours of Java tutorials ion YouTube
Signed up for some online Java coursework 

Struggles: 
My struggles remain internal and I have been set back a little by some personal family issues that I work to overcome as the semester continues. I hope I can find a way to get my confidence to where I think it should be. I am not sure why I feel the way I do, but the feeling that I do not belong in this course is either a  sign that I donâ€™t believe I can do the work, or I am not a good fit for a career in Java Programming? I am not sure which....maybe just jitters still. I have made some steps towards helping myself to gain more confidence with Java. I watched several hours of some simple Java servlet and web app tutorials and signed up for an online course. If I work on these in the background, maybe I can fill in these perceived blanks. Let's hope that this is a positive step.  

I am now pretty solid on what I am going to do for the project. Discussed it in passing with the instructor and it seems like I am on the right path.  

Next Week Plan:
I did not get Week 2 work done on time and am now a little behind. I need to work on Week 2 assignments and Week 3 assignments and get these all turned in. I will need to get up to asking the correct questions as needed. Make sure that I am working on Java outside of the coursework to raise my confidence levels. Work on getting the problem statements, user stories and other items ready for the individual project and also start looking at the professional development activity as well.
