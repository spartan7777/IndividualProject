Enterprise Java Individual Project

Project Name: The Concept Compendium

Problem Statement: 
The purpose of this application is to take the creation and iteration of concepts for writers and creators to a more organized and reflective level. The use of paper notes and books to contain ideas such as these can work, but these methods make referencing older ideas and comparing ideas against one another in real time very difficult. The application attempts to solve these problems. The application is going to provide a quick stopping place for users to record ideas in their most raw form when creation hits. The application can also allow for users to pull all of these ideas together based on very common traits or very specific unique ones that will allow these ideas to be reviewed, updated and cross referenced with one another. Having such control over these ideas will allow creators to provide further definition or expansion on certain ideas as needed as well as provide the ability to catalog these ideas in order to avoid excessive repetition.
